# mineflayer-bloodhound

Is a mineflayer plugin that allows the bot to find who is responsible for damage to another entity.

Not 100% reliable and at the mercy of bot latency.

WIP: Currently only supports melee type damage, but support for projectiles is coming.

A simple example of its usage can be found in the /examples folder
